Since (ai+aj)modx=0
, it follows that (aimodx+ajmodx)modx=0
, which implies that aimodx+ajmodx
 is either x
 or 0
. Therefore, for some j
, this holds true if aimodx=(x−ajmodx)modx
.

Since (ai−aj)mody=0
, it follows that aimody−ajmody=0
, which implies that aimody=ajmody
.


for find if there exits or not a subarray such that the sum of the subarray is 0 
then u can use the hash map + prefix sum methoed 
caluclate the perfix sum 
update teh hashmap if the prefix sum is not already presnet or is not 0 

then u would now if the value ever comes to 0 or if the same vlaue reqpest tehne there must exits a sequxce whose sum is 0
